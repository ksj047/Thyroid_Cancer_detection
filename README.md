# Thyroid Cancer Detection

Detect Thyroid Cancer Reoccurrence using patient data.

## Objective

Build a system that can predict if a Thyroid Cancer survivor can relapse (their cancer reoccurs).

## Dataset

This dataset contains data about thyroid checkups for people with a diagnosis and is a comprehensive collection of patient information, specifically focused on individuals diagnosed with cancer.

## Description of Columns

- **Physical Examination**: Findings from a physical examination of the patient.
- **Adenopathy**: Presence or absence of enlarged lymph nodes (adenopathy) in the neck region.
- **Pathology**: Specific type of thyroid cancer determined by the pathological examination of biopsy samples.
- **Focality**: Whether the cancer is unifocal (limited to one location) or multifocal (present in multiple locations).
- **Risk**: The risk category of the cancer based on various factors, such as tumor size, extent of spread, and histological type.
- **T**: Tumor classification based on its size and extent of invasion into nearby structures.
- **N**: Nodal classification indicating the involvement of lymph nodes.
- **M**: Metastasis classification indicating the presence or absence of distant metastases.
- **Stage**: The overall stage of the cancer, typically determined by combining T, N, and M classifications.
- **Response**: Response to treatment, indicating whether the cancer responded positively, negatively, or remained stable after treatment.
